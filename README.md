## Pong Except the Pretty Lights can Predict Your Fortune
**Epilepsy warning: Blinking lights (as requested by the worksheet!)**

* Turn the potentiometers to move the paddles.  
* The lights on your side of the controller will tell you where the ball will next land on your side. To move your paddle into place, turn it towards the brighter light until it dims.
* When both lights start blinking, your paddle is in the right place.  
* When a player wins, the current scores are indicated by the LEDs on your side.  
* After three points, the winning side blinks in a celebratory disco fashion and the game is reset.
